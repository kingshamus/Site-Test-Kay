            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Welcome!</p>
            <p>I'm Kay and I was born to be an artist.</p>
            <p>I can’t actually remember a time that I wasn’t drawing or painting. It drove my Mum mad as I’d make such a mess of the carpet in my room (cleverly disguised by the careful placing of a rug)!</p>
            <p>The Royal College of London accepted me at just 16 years old to join them, but unfortunately, I had to get a job to help with family finances and my dreams of becoming an illustrator had to be put on hold. A hold that lasted for many years.</p>
            <p>When covid struck it made me rethink my life as it did for many people, and I took that opportunity to leave my job and start my life as an artist. I haven’t looked back since.</p>
            <p>Now every morning I wake up excited to get into the studio and create!</p>
            <p>My style has a modern feel to it, bright and colourful; yet it still captures the look and character of the subject whether that be your beloved pet or a wedding portrait or a landscape.</p>
            <p>As well as my commission work, I create my own illustrations which are turned into cards and home decor; these can be bought from my <a href="https://www.etsy.com/your-shop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Etsy shop</a>.</p>
            <p>I hope that you find joy in my work and if you are interested in commissioning a portrait or purchasing one of my original pieces then please drop me a line in the <a href="contact.html">contact section</a>.</p>
            <p>Much Love</p>
            <p>Kay x</p>
